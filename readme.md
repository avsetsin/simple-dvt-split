# Split Contracts Deployment UI

Simple UI for deploying split contracts that automate the rewards distribution among participants for Lido Simple DVT module. Deployed contracts are chained, which wraps the stETH rewards in wstETH and then distributes them to the cluster participants.

Deployed UI is available on Vercel: https://simple-dvt-split.vercel.app/

## Reward Distribution

The contracts to be deployed assume the following scheme of rewards distribution among cluster members:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
	NO(["Node Operator"])
	W(["Wrapper"])
	S(["Split"])
	MS(["Main split"])
	P1(["Participant 1"])
	P2(["Participant 2"])
	P3(["Participant 3"])
	NO -- stETH --> W
	W -- wstETH --> S
	S --> MS
	MS --> P1
	MS --> P2
	MS --> P3

## Deployable Contracts

The UI allows deploying 2 contracts from factories:

**Split Ð¡ontract**. A contract that distributes rewards to participants. It uses the 0xSplit factory [0x2ed6c4B5dA6378c7897AC67Ba9e43102Feb694EE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4B5dA6378c7897AC67Ba9e43102Feb694EE) for contract deployment.

**Wrapper Contract**. The contract that is specified as the `rewardAddress` of a node operator. Wraps `stETH` rewards to `wstETH` and sends it to the split contract.

## Usage

**Install dependencies**. The project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a dependency manager. First you need to install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

**Build**. To build the UI, use the command:

```bash
yarn build
```

The project source files will be transpiled and placed in the `dist` directory. These files can be used for publishing.

**Start**. To start the UI on the test server locally, use the command:

```bash
yarn start
```

The UI will be available at http://localhost:8000.
